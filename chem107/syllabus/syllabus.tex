\section{Course Description}
This course provides a general introduction to the basic concepts, principles and laws
of modern chemistry. Topics include a study of atomic theory, molecular structure,
chemical reactivity, and the properties of the various phases of matter. Laboratory
experiments include both qualitative and quantitative analysis, with an emphasis on
proper laboratory techniques. This course applies to the physical science requirement
for general education and is not acceptable for credit for students majoring in physical
science. CHEM 107C is a recommended preparatory course for students planning to take
CHEM 111AC AND CHEM 111BC. No credit if taken after CHEM 111AC. Pass/No Pass/Letter
Grade Option

\textbf{Prerequisite:}  Completion of MATH 40C, MATH 41C or equivalent.

\section{Academic Honesty (From the Cypress College Catalog)}

Students are expected to abide by ethical standards in preparing and
presenting material which demonstrates their level of knowledge and which is
used to determine grades. Such standards are founded on basic concepts of
integrity and honesty. These include, but are not limited to the following areas:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Students shall not plagiarize, which is defined as stealing or passing
  off as one's own ideas or words of another and as using a creative production
  without crediting the source. The following cases are examples of what
  constitutes plagiarism:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item paraphrasing published material without acknowledging the source.
  \item  making significant use of an idea or a particular arrangement of ideas,
    e.g., outlines.
  \item  writing a paper after consulting with persons who provide suitable
    ideas and incorporating these ideas into the paper without acknowledging the debt.
  \item submitting under one’s own name, term papers or other reports which have
    been prepared by others.
  \end{itemize}
\item Students shall not cheat, which is defined as using notes, aids, or
  the help of other students on tests or exams in ways other than those expressly
  permitted by the instructor; and as misreporting or altering the data in laboratory
  or research projects involving the collection of data.
\item Students shall not submit an original paper or project to more than one class
  without approval from the second instructor. Instructors who do not accept previously
  submitted papers should so inform the students in the course syllabus.
\item Students shall not furnish materials or information in order to enable another
  student to plagiarize or cheat.
\end{enumerate}


An instructor who has evidence that an act of academic dishonesty has occurred,
after speaking with the student, is obligated to take the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assign an appropriate academic penalty such as an oral reprimand (as in
  cases where there is reasonable doubt that the student knew that the action
  violated the standards of honesty); or assign an “F” on all or part of a particular
  paper, project, or exam (for example, where there was proof that it was a one-time
  occurrence). In cases where an “F” was assigned, report the incident to all
  appropriate personnel. (See Step 3).
\item In cases where the dishonesty was serious, premeditated, or part of an ongoing
  scheme, request an ad hoc review board made up of at least three faculty from the
  department or division of the instructor involved. This review board is to be
  appointed by the Academic Senate President or his/her delegate in consultation with
  the department coordinator, or if none is in place, with the members of the department.
  Supply to the review board the documents which are suspect and any other documents
  completed by the student which might help determine if academic dishonesty occurred.
  It would then be the responsibility of the review board to determine academic penalties
  as appropriate.
\item Report to the student involved, to the department coordinator, to the Division Dean,
  and to the Dean of Counseling and Student Development, the alleged incident of academic
  dishonesty, including relevant documentation, and recommendations for action that he
  or she deems appropriate.
\item The appropriate Division Dean shall maintain an academic dishonesty file of all cases
  of academic dishonesty with the appropriate documentation.
\item Students shall be informed when their names are inserted into the file and provided
  with copies of any appeals or disciplinary procedures in which they may become involved.
  The appropriate Division Dean may initiate disciplinary proceedings under Education Code,
  Article 3, Section 76030-76037; when two or more incidents involving the same student occur,
  he/she shall do so.
\item  Students charged with violations resulting in disciplinary action have the right
  to appeal the findings to the Petitions Committee under the Rules and Procedures of Due
  Process.
\end{enumerate}
