\maketitle 

1) Convert the following:

a) 32.5 dag to its equivalent in cg.

b) 44 mm to nm.

c) 25 cm$^3$ to L.

d) 2.89 GJ to MJ.

e) 172 $\mu\text{g}$ to ds.

2) A sample of air contains $2.33 \times 10^{-4}$ mg of lead per mL of gas.
This air passes through an office, the volume of which is $3.25 \times 10^4$ L.
Seven people normally work in this office. How many $\mu\text{g}$ of lead will each
person in the office receive from this sample of air?

3) If a laser beam fired from the moon takes 1.40s to reach Earth, what is the
distance in meters between the moon and Earth? Light travels in a vacuum
at a speed of $3.00 \times 10^{10}$ cm per second.

4) Amoxicillin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial infections.
When given to infants, the dosage must be carefully determined. The usual
daily dosage for infants under 3 months old is 30.0 milligrams (mg) per kilogram
(kg) of body weight. What mass of amoxicillin in milligrams should be given to
an 8.00 lb infant in one day?
