\textbf{Ideal Gas Law}

1) Assuming constant temperature. Determine the final pressure when 8.00mL
krypton at 1.97atm is transferred to a vessel of volume 1.0L.

\vspace{0.25in}

2) An outdoor storage container for hydrogen gas with a volume of 300kL is
at 2.0 atm and 10$^\circ$C. The temperature rises to 40$^\circ$C. What is the
new pressure of the hydrogen in the container?

3) What is the density of chloroform (CHCl$_3$) with a vapor pressure
at 0.267atm and 300K?

\vspace{0.25in}

4) What mass of ammonia (NH$_3$) will exert the same pressure as 10mg of
hydrogen sulfide (H$_2$S) in the same container under the same conditions?

\vspace{0.25in}

5) Nitroglycerin (C$_3$H$_5$(NO$_3$)$_3$) is highly sensitive and detonates
by the reaction

4 C$_3$H$_5$(NO$_3$)$_3$(l) $\rightarrow$ 6 N$_2$(g) + 10 H$_2$O(g) + 12 CO$_2$(g)
+ O$_2$(g)

Calculate the total volume of product gases at 2.12atm and 300$^\circ$C from
the detonation of 450g of nitroglycerin.
